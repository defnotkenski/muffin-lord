## Development Preferences

- **Show, don't modify**: When suggesting code changes, display the proposed code rather than directly editing files
- User prefers to review and apply changes manually

## Claude AI Code Guidance

- When told to check the source code of a library, look at the source code within my environment instead of a web search
- Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear
- Do not jump to conclusions without fully understanding the tools available. ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU NEED TO.
